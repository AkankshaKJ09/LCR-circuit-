## 📘 Overview

LCR circuits are foundational in electrical engineering and physics. This simulation demonstrates key principles such as:
- Natural frequency
- Damping behavior
- Resonance phenomenon
- Phase shift and impedance

## ⚙️ Circuit Description

The simulated circuit includes:
- **L (Inductor)**: stores energy in a magnetic field.
- **C (Capacitor)**: stores energy in an electric field.
- **R (Resistor)**: dissipates energy as heat.
- The configuration may be **series** or **parallel**.

## 💻 Features

- Simulates time-domain response (under-damped, critically damped, over-damped)
- Plots voltage/current across L, C, and R
- Computes resonance frequency and bandwidth
- Frequency sweep analysis (Bode plots)
- Interactive parameter tuning (if GUI-enabled)
